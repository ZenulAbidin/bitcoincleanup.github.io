# SEC's Gensler says PoS cryptos might be classifed as securities

Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, has recently hinted that the SEC might classify proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies as securities. Up until now, they ware generally accepted with the commodities classification.

Gensler did not specifically mention Ethereum, but given that it has recently completed the Merge, the transition to Proof of Stake, it could potentially also be classified as a security. However, he also mentioned that Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, is not a security as there are no middlemen, unlike "a vast majority" of other cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum's price dipped by about 11% after his comments.

## The point being...

The news is not about Ethereum's price dropping - all cryptocurrencies do that. It's about how the SEC could potentially re-classify Ethereum as a security in the future.

The difference is the commodities are less regulated than securities, because they are not regulated by the SEC - which has a track record of tearing up corporate fraud.

The implications will reach exchanges, who are responsible for listing cryptocurrencies in the first place. Some, like [Coinbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech-ecommerce/crypto-regulation-sec-cftc/), do not list securities at all. If Ethereum is one day regulated as a security, it would be placed under much more regulatory pressure than it is now.

## Not Bitcoin's problem

Bitcoin does not have to worry about being reclassified as a security, because it does not use staking in the first place. Instead, miners can opt to use greener forms of energy, striking deals with utilities to buy up surplus electricity and get paid to use less, and moving out of places where there is a shortage of electricity on the grid.
